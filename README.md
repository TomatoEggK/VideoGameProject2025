My final game project for Video Game Programming

## Beat Adventure
- ###Mechanics
  - There are beat and rhythm hints including music hints and visual hints 
  - Pressing keyboard at the good timing hurys the monsters or boss. Mistake hurt the player.
  - There is a health(HP) bar and an attacking (ATK) bar for the player and enemy. Lower health of the player makes the music go faster.
  - There is level-up choice (more health or more attack)  

- ###Dynamics  
  - Correct key = damage to enemy & Wrong key = damage to player  
  - Low health → faster music → more challenge  
  - Player choices create different play styles  

- ###Aesthetics 
  - Comic pixel art look  
  - Feeling of rhythm and action  
  - Players feel more confident while growing and challenging with faster rhythms when lower HP.
