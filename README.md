## Beat Adventure
- ### Pitch
  - *Beat Adventure* is a rhythm battle game with adventure elements. The player follows the beat and presses keys at the right time to attack enemies. If the timing is wrong, the player loses health. When health gets lower, the music and rhythms becomes faster. After each level, the player can choose to increase health or increase attack power, creating different play styles. The game uses a comic-style pixel look to give a retro and fun feeling.
